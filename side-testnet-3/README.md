# SIDE Testnet 3

Welcome to Side-Testnet-3, a testing environment specifically designed to evaluate the functionality of Bitcoin's Native SegWit addresses on the SIDE blockchain. Our primary goal is to thoroughly test the signing and verification processes of transactions using popular Bitcoin wallets such as OKX and Unisats.

In this testnet environment, developers and users can experiment with Native SegWit Bitcoin addresses, including signing transactions, verifying transactions, and interacting with the SIDE blockchain seamlessly using Bitcoin wallets.

We encourage developers, testers, and blockchain enthusiasts to join us in exploring the capabilities of Native SegWit Bitcoin addresses on SIDE and providing valuable feedback to enhance the interoperability and functionality of our blockchain ecosystem.

SIDE-Testnet-3 is set to be launched in a decentralized manner, with gentx submissions accepted from now until next Monday (UTC 14:00, March 25). The genesis block is planned to start at 15:00 UTC. Join us in this exciting launch and contribute to the success of SIDE-Testnet-3!
